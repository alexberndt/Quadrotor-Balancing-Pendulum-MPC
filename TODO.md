## TODO List

Issues to be considered/addressed:
- Alternative control scenarios (e.g. constant velocity pendulum 
  equilibrium),
- Disturbance rejection of e.g. sinusoidal input
- Insight into physically realistic actuator limitations (roll, pitch and 
  yaw rate limits etc based on estimated rotational and translational 
  inertia of the quadrotor, rotor thrust curves, blade dynamics etc).

The experimental parameters of the quadrotor as used by the team at ETH 
Zurich can be found in literature directory of this repository
